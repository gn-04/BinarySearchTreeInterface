# BinarySearchTreeInterface
Command Line Interface to work with a BST built from scratch with Java


This program gives the user 2 options.

Option 1 is to perform basic BST operations(insert, delete, search, disply, getAverageLevel, etc.) using instances of an NFL Player class. 

Option 2 automatically generates 25 BSTs filled with random ints. The size starts at 2^17 (131,072). Every 5 trees the size increases to the next power of 2 until 2^21 (2,097,152). For every tree, the size, height and average level is displayed in the terminal.
